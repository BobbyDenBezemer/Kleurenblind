## Intro

We can easily make html presentations using R markdown. It's very easy to learn. The great asset is that we can run python syntax in code chunks

```{r,echo = FALSE}
require(ggplot2)

```


## Slide with Bullets

We can also easily make lists 

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

One explanation for this unexpected finding is that ideal cut diamonds also tend to be **smaller**.  
The mean is \(E(carat | cut = Ideal) = `r mean(subset(diamonds, cut == "Ideal")$carat)`\), and size is related to price.

## Slide with R Code and Output

```{r,engine='python', echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
test = []
for i in range(1,11):
  test.append(i)
print test

```
